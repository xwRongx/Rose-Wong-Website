  <p> Hi. I am currently a senior at Ruben S. Ayala High School. I want to aspirationaly be a aerospace engineer and make cars. I don't know why but the world has always been fasicanting because it works the way it does and I want to know why it works that way. Image we all looked deforemed and lived on a planet that looks like a cube, just something out of the realms of reality.</p>
